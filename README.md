# Finder Family: Re-Integration of Institutionalized Children
This repository contains Finder Family web-application code that was used in development of a reintegration web-application system that aims to help members of the public identify children they know and initiate a connection
process.
## Introduction
Finder Family is is a web-based application system that aims to connect children with thier relatives or parents while also establishing a financial support system. The application aims to work in partnership with state owned public-rescue centers which prepare children through specialized programs before reintegration.
